# OPI Network Common APIs

The common network capabilities need to build on the general capabilities that exist across various use cases for network operations and configuration. This includes (but is not limited to):

- Physical ports
- Logical ports
- Layer 2 interfaces, switches, bridges
- Layer 3 routing operations

The objective of the network common API is to define the characteristics that are common for the general network operations and capture them in this common API.  These characteristics are the building blocks that can be used across use cases and allow the basic setup of the physical and logical ports, VLANs, LAG interfaces, switches, etc.
